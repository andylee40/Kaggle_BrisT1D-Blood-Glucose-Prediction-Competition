### Goal
Forecast blood glucose levels one hour ahead using the previous six hours of participant data.

### Dataset
The dataset is from a study that collected data from young adults in the UK with type 1 diabetes, who used a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), an insulin pump and a smartwatch. These devices collected blood glucose readings, insulin dosage, carbohydrate intake, and activity data. The data collected was aggregated to five-minute intervals and formatted into samples. Each sample represents a point in time and includes the aggregated five-minute intervals from the previous six hours. The aim is to predict the blood glucose reading an hour into the future, for each of these samples.



### Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on Root **Mean Square Error (RMSE)** between the predicted blood glucose levels an hour into the future and the actual values that were then collected.

### Rank

I ranked 386th out of 635 participants, placing me in the **top 60.7%** of all competitors.
